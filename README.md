**Windows Sensitivity Switcher**      
**Why?**    
Windows has no good way to handle high DPI Mice.  
In a typical optimal setup when playing a fps you'd want the following setup:  
-5/10 Windows Sensitivity.  
-Your Mouse set to the Best DPI for it's sensor.  
-Change mouse sensitivity in-game.  
-Ensure raw-input is on if possible.  
Unfortunatly if you do this you will likely be unable to navigate when out of games or using menus since when your cursor is unlocked it will be too sensitive.  
With this you can get the most out of your sensor and still actually use your computer!  
  
Note: I plan to look into just checking if the cursor is locked and adjusting based on that.  
  
  
**What?**    
-HotKeys to swap between Sensitivities (Default Alt+1 and Alt+2)  
-UI to swap between Sensitivities.
